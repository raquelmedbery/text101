  storyText: "As if sensing your awe the man nods his head with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"There
    hasn't been anyone that strong in years because the nobles are too afraid. They
    stay locked in their mansions as war, famine, and disease ruin the land. Now is
    the time for someone to stand up and bring peace back to this world, and only
    someone with all that power can do it! That person will be me, and the spells
    in that book will help me achieve my goal.\"\r\n\r\nHe says all of this with a
    crazed look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n1. Say you'll help him\r\n2. Call him insane "
