  storyText: "If what that man said earlier is true why not take the book for yourself?
    Get out of this boring life as a librarian. He doesn't seem to be sane enough
    to have something that powerful anyway, and who knows if he'll actually help you.
    \ \r\n\r\nThere are traps scattered around the restricted area for intruders.
    If a librarian didn't place a seal of passage on a patron upon entering the restricted
    area the traps will trigger. Even with his magic he shouldn't be able to detect
    them. Maybe you can trick him in setting off one of the traps?\r\n\r\n1. Continue"
