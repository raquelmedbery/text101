  storyText: "You unhook the ring of keys attached to your belt. Moving slowly so
    they don't jingle too much you go to unlock the door. The figure doesn't pay you
    any notice as they scan the shelves of books. As you creep up behind them quietly
    you notice that the unnatural glow is coming from a ball of light levitating in
    their hand. A magic user then, explains how they got into the locked area. They
    still haven't noticed you.\r\n\r\n1. Approach and say hello\r\n2. Magic users
    can be dangerous. Grab a book and knock them out."
