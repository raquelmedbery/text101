  storyText: "You decide to go back to work. As you pick up the next book you see
    a light go on in the restricted section. You know for sure that you let no one
    in there. The few patrons that came in today were all students who were looking
    for simple research books. Nothing that would require the restricted section.
    You're a novice with vague ties to a family of librarians. There are already whispers
    from the more traditional librarians of taking away your position. Should you
    go check just in case?\r\n\r\n1. Go investigate\r\n2. Ignore and continue your
    work"
