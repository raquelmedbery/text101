  storyText: "Decision made you go back to sorting your books. After a few more minutes
    of continuing your task the light you saw flares off and a strange dark ripple
    emanates from the restricted area through the rest of the library.\r Slightly
    worried, you remember the man has magic and decide to continue minding your own
    business. \r\n\r\nWhen the senior librarians come back from their meeting they
    head straight for the restricted area. You forgot they have a sixth sense for
    trouble, and upon finding the cloaked figure passed out after triggering one of
    their containment spells they punish you for your incompetence. Thrown to the
    streets, you live the rest of your life as a beggar. \n\nPlay Again?\n1. Yes\n2.
    No"
