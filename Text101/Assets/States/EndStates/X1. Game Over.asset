  storyText: "You decide that sorting through the books is more important than protecting
    the restricted area. After a few more minutes of continuing your task the light
    you saw flares off and a strange dark ripple emanates from the restricted area
    through the rest of the library.\r\n\r\nThough weird, you soon get absorbed into
    your task again and forget about it. When the senior librarians come back from
    their meeting they head straight for the restricted area. You forgot they had
    a sixth sense for trouble, and upon finding the cloaked figure passed out after
    triggering one of their containment spells they punish you for your incompetence.
    Thrown to the streets, you live the rest of your life as a beggar. \n\nPlay Again?\n1.
    Yes\n2. No"
