    rug farther in the restricted area. There are spells like this hidden everywhere
    within the restricted area. Unbeknowst to the people who use it, whenever anyone
    enters the restricted area the librarian on duty is to place a seal of passage
    on them. Whoever in the restricted area doesn't have the seal will trigger the
    spells. You finish dragging the body onto the rug and step out of the way as you
    watch a circle of blue glow on the ground as it triggers.\r\n\r\n1. Continue"
